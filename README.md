#CSE475 Project

Handwritten Image Classifiation with Keras using MNIST and Fashion MNIST data

In this project, we will work with image data, the famous MNIST and Fashion MNIST data sets. MNIST data set contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) in grayscale (0=black, 255 = white). Fashion MNIST data set contains 70,000 images of clothing in grayscale (0=black, 255 = white). All the images are 28 pixels by 28 pixels for a total of 784 pixels. This is quite small by image standards. Also, the images are well centered and isolated.

For the project a simple CNN was implemented. I decided to use ResNet model architecture for this image classification task
